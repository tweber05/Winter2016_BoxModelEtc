<h1>Intro to Inline and block</h1>This file uses some of the default inline and block elements to demonstrate how the browser treats them differently. <em>Inline elements, like this emphasis element, wrap along with the text they mark. Notice that, if you change the size of your browser window, so the text re-wraps, the em element re-wraps with it</em><h2>Block elements, like this h2, always take up the full width of the container.</h2>Notice that, if you resize the page, the h2 always is on its own line, seperate from the text above and below, even as it re-wraps and becomes taller and shorter. Weirdly enough, images, like this one: <img src="ripley_corn.jpg" alt="Ripley says this is Cat Corn, and I won't like it"> are also inline by default, and placed at the baseline of the text, like a character. We'll change this, though.
